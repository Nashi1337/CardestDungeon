    History became legend ...\r\nlegend became myth.\r\nFADE UP: The waters of the
    ANDUIN RIVER lie dark and\r\nundisturbed.\r\n GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT\u2019D)\r\nAnd

    whisper)\r\n My preciousness.\r\n GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT\u2019D)\r\nThe Ring
    gave to Gollum unnatural long\r\nlife. For five hundred years it\r\npoisoned
    his mind. And in the gloom of\r\nGollum's cave...\r\n FADE TO BLACK\r\n GALADRIEL
    (V.O.) (CONT\u2019D)\r\n It waited.\r\nFADE UP: Bathed in COLD MOONLIGHT, the
    WORLD lies DARK and\r\nSTILL ... the unsettled quiet before the storm...\r\n
    GALADRIEL (V.O.)\r\n Darkness crept back into the forests\r\nof the world. Rumor
    grew of a Shadow in\r\nthe East ... whispers of a nameless\r\nfear. And the Ring
    of Power perceived\r\n... its time had now come. It abandoned\r\nGollum.\r\nSLOW
    MOTION: Unseen by its KEEPER, THE RING falls to the MUDDY\r\nFLOOR of a MOUNTAIN

    RINGING through the\r\nCOLD, DANK TUNNELS...\r\n GOLLUM (V.O.)\r\n Lost! Lost!
    My Precious is lost!!\r\nFrightened, BILBO quickly POCKETS the ONE RING and hurries

    between them on the table.\r\n (CONTINUED)\r\n40.\r\nCONTINUED:\r\n GANDALF\r\nNo,
    Frodo. The spirit of Sauron endured.\r\nHis life force is bound to the Ring and\r\nthe
    Ring survived. Sauron has returned.\r\nHis Orcs have multiplied ... his\r\nfortress
    of Barad-d\xFBr is rebuilt in the\r\nland of Mordor. Sauron needs only this\r\nRing
    to cover all the lands in the\r\nsecond darkness. He is seeking it,\r\nseeking
    it, all his thought is bent on\r\nit. For the Ring yearns, above all else,\r\nto
    return to the hand of its master:\r\nThey are one, the Ring and the Dark\r\nLord.

    ON: SAM, MERRY, and PIPPIN huddled over a small fire ...\r\nSAUSAGES and BACON
    sizzle in a hot frying pan.\r\n FRODO\r\n What are you doing?\r\n MERRY\r\n Tomatoes,
    sausages, and crispy bacon.\r\n SAM\r\n We saved some for you, Mr. Frodo.\r\n
    FRODO\r\n Put it out, you fools! put it out!\r\n PIPPIN\r\n Oh, that's nice ...
    ash on my tomatoes!\r\nA SUDDEN SHRIEK!\r\nANGLE ON: FIVE RINGWRAITHS ON FOOT,
    running up the steep slope\r\nunnaturally fast.\r\n FRODO\r\n Go!\r\nFRODO, SAM,
    MERRY, and PIPPIN clamber desperately towards the\r\nsummit, clutching their
    swords.\r\n CUT TO:\r\nEXT. WEATHERTOP SUMMIT - NIGHT\r\nFRODO, SAM, MERRY, and
    PIPPIN race into a RING OF BROKEN STONES\r\non the summit on WEATHERTOP ... the
    ruined base of an ancient\r\ntower.\r\n (CONTINUED)\r\n74.\r\nCONTINUED:\r\nThe
    HOBBITS stand back-to-back in the centre of the RING,\r\nwaiting for the first
    assault...\r\nANGLE ON: One by one, the 5 RINGWRAITHS appear ... brandishing\r\nGLEAMING
    SWORDS, they move slowly towards the HOBBITS. In the\r\ncenter is their leader
    ... the WITCH KING!\r\n SAM\r\n Back, you devils!\r\nANGLE ON: SAM rushes forward
    with a cry. He swings his sword at\r\nthe WITCH KING, who blocks the blow with
    his own sword. SAM\u2019S\r\nblade shatters ... the WITCH KING lashes out with
    his fist,\r\nsending SAM flying.\r\nANGLE ON: MERRY and PIPPIN, overcome with
    terror, throw\r\nthemselves flat on the ground.\r\nANGLE ON: The RINGWRAITHS
    close in on FRODO ... a VENOMOUS\r\nWHISPER dances in his head...\r\nANGLE ON:
    FRODO shuts his eyes and staggers back, desperately\r\nresisting the WRAITH\u2019S
    WHISPERINGS ... SLOW MOTION as his hand\r\ngoes into his pocket and pulls out
    the RING. The 5 RINGWRAITHS\r\nutter a chilling SCREECH OF EXCITEMENT. FRODO
    is unable to\r\nresist any longer, falls to his knees and slips on the RING.
    He\r\nDISAPPEARS.\r\n SAM (CONT\u2019D)\r\n No!\r\nIN THE TWILIGHT WORLD:\r\nANGLE
    ON: FRODO finds himself in the weird TWILIGHT WORLD ... he\r\nlooks upon the
    RINGWRAITHS, now visible in their TRUE\r\nAPPEARANCE: FIVE GHOULS dressed in
    long GREY ROBES, with white\r\nhair, and PALLID ruthless faces.\r\nTHE WITCH
    KING extends a haggard hand towards FRODO, reaching\r\nfor the RING on his finger.
    FRODO\u2019S trembling hand extends\r\nforward, as if by the pull of the RING
    ... he slides to the\r\nground, unable to pull his hand away.\r\nThe WITCH KING
    snarls and springs forward. He stabs at FRODO\r\nwith a wicked DAGGER! FRODO
    winces as the tip of the dagger\r\nsinks into his shoulder.\r\n (CONTINUED)\r\n75.\r\nCONTINUED:
    (2)\r\nSUDDENLY, STRIDER charges at the RINGWRAITHS, wielding his sword\r\nin
    one hand, a FLAMING TORCH in the other. He moves in SLOW\r\nMOTION, visible through
    a sea of mist.\r\nFRODO sinks to the ground. Behind him is a faint image of a\r\nRINGWRAITH
    fleeing, his head engulfed in flames. With draining\r\nstrength, FRODO manages
    to pull the RING off his finger...\r\nIN THE REAL WORLD: ...APPEARING back in
    the real world, SAM\r\nrushes over to him.\r\n SAM (CONT\u2019D)\r\n (horrified)\r\n
    Frodo!\r\nAnother RINGWRAITH is burning and screaming ... others screech\r\nfearfully
    at the flames, turn and flee from the WEATHERTOP\r\nSUMMIT.\r\n SAM (CONT\u2019D)\r\n
    (panicked)\r\n Mr. Frodo!!\r\nSTRIDER kneels before FRODO. He snatches up the
    WITCH KING\u2019S\r\nDAGGER from the ground, staring gravely at the long, thin,\r\nblade.\r\n
    SAM (CONT\u2019D)\r\n Help him, Strider!\r\n STRIDER\r\n (grim)\r\n He's been
    stabbed by a Morgul blade.\r\nThe MORGUL BLADE suddenly melts ... vanishing into
    the air like\r\nsmoke. STRIDER throws the hilt down in disgust...\r\n SAM\r\n
    Do something.\r\n STRIDER\r\n This is beyond my skill to heal.\r\n (urgently)\r\n
    He needs Elvish medicine.\r\nSTRIDER lifts FRODO onto his shoulders.\r\n76.\r\nEXT.
    WEATHERHILLS - NIGHT\r\nSTRIDER is jogging grimly, carrying an ailing FRODO on
    his back.\r\nSAM, MERRY, and PIPPIN are running to keep up. The HOBBITS are\r\ncarrying
    FLAMING TORCHES for protection.\r\n STRIDER\r\n Hurry!\r\n SAM\r\n We are six
    days from Rivendell.\r\nFRODO groans.\r\n STRIDER\r\n Hold on, Frodo\r\n SAM\r\n
    He\u2019ll never make it!\r\nCLOSE ON: FRODO ... head lolling about, barely conscious.\r\n
    FRODO\r\n (fevered calling)\r\n Gandalf ... Gandalf?"
